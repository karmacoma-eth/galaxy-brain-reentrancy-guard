# üß† Galaxy Brain Reentrancy Guard

Billions have been lost to reentrancy attacks. It's time to put a stop to this madness.

Galaxy Brain Reentrancy Guard *guarantees* that the targeted external call can not make any additional calls, for the low price of 3.7M gas:

```
Running 2 tests for test/GalaxyBrainReentrancyGuard.t.sol:GalaxyBrainReentrancyGuardTest
[PASS] testBad() (gas: 3692142)
[PASS] testGood() (gas: 3689278)
```

## How does this work?

The EVM supports a maximum call stack depth of 1024. Therefore, when you're the frame at the top of a stack of 1024 calls, you can't create any additional calls. Now, that's security!

There is no native way to know the current call stack depth in the EVM, so [GalaxyBrainReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/karmacoma-eth/galaxy-brain-reentrancy-guard/blob/main/src/GalaxyBrainReentrancyGuard.sol) uses recursion to create a stack with the maximum depth. It keeps calling itself until it starts failing, then it calls the final destination.

```solidity
function _nonReentrant(MessageCall memory call) public returns (bool success, bytes memory returndata) {
    require(msg.sender == address(this), "WRONG_SENDER");

    try GalaxyBrainReentrancyGuard(address(this)).test_hop() {
        // ‚õèÔ∏è test_hop succeeded, need to go deeper
        (success, returndata) = GalaxyBrainReentrancyGuard(address(this))._nonReentrant(call);
    } catch {
        // üëå test_hop failed, we reached the max call height
        (success, returndata) = call.target.call{value: call.value}(call.data);
    }
}
```

## Is this a joke?

What is reality? Why are we here? This line of questioning is really getting us nowhere.
